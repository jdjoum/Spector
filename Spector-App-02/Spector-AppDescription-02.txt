During our next iteration of the Spector App design our goal was to remove the buttons that were used in the demo phase to show that a bluetooth connection was established.
Then we added text to display that the area is safe when no breach has occurred and that the security has been breached when a breach occurs.
When a breach occurs an alarm sound will be played and the user will be notified via the app. After the breach occurs and when an animal/human is no longer near the sensor the alarm will stop and the area will display that the area is safe again.
