# Spector "The Space Detector"
### Presented By: Julian-Justin Djoum & Richard Altamore

   The Spector, also known as The Space Detector, is a motion-triggered sensor that’s designed to let its users know via an Android Application when a human or animal enters/exits a certain area in a home. It’s designed to be set up at the bottom of a doorway by the user, so they can monitor and be aware of if someone has entered their room when they're away.
